# Innes Rail

This project contains the investigations of standards, technology, organisations and communities for model railroads.

I plan to start my first build, but have been a little overwhelmed by the options and terminology thrown at someone new to the hobby.

One of the goals of the railway I want to build to to have the layout fully automated, with computer control of trains, signals, points, etc. but also allowing me to control a train on the layout.
